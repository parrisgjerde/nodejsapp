This code is used to capture sendgrid webhook data.
Steps:
1) In a separate windo run ngrok (in Downloads) as "ngrok http 8080"
   Note - an ngrok auth key must reside in ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
2) copy ngrok Forwarding URL as the URL used in the sendgrid webhook definition
3) In another window, in the current directory, execute the server listen8080.js
   node listen8080.js
4) In another window, goto the ~/bmh/sendgrid folder and execute the file
   single_webapi.sh test
   for example, you should eventually see webhook data printed to the console
   in the node js window (ngrok does some logging as well)
